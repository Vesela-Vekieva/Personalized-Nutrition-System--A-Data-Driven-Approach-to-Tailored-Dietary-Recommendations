# Personalized Nutrition System: Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project represents **Phase 1** of building a Personalized Nutrition Recommendation System. The goal of this stage is to **clean, preprocess, and analyze two datasets** (Dietary Habits & Lifestyle and Food Macronutrients) to prepare high-quality data for future machine learning models.

## Datasets
1. **Dietary Habits & Lifestyle Dataset**  
   - Synthetic dataset generated based on **global dietary and lifestyle statistics**.  
   - Includes demographic, lifestyle, and dietary information such as age, BMI, meal frequency, exercise habits, and health conditions.  
   - Size: ~5000 records. 

2. **Food Macronutrients Dataset**  
   - Created by combining and cleaning **three separate datasets**: fruits, vegetables, and other various foods.  
   - Contains nutritional information for various food items, including energy (kcal), protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and sugar content.  
   - Final cleaned and merged dataset size: ~3500 records.  

##  Key Steps in This Phase
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked and handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Standardized column names and formats.
   - Corrected data inconsistencies and ensured uniform representation across datasets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of key features.
   - Correlation checks for understanding relationships.
   - Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, and boxplots for insights.

## Outcomes
- Two fully cleaned and normalized datasets ready for machine learning models.
- Insights into dietary patterns, lifestyle habits, and nutrient composition.
- Identification of potential features for predictive modeling.

## Visualizations
- Feature distributions by demographic and diet type.
- Correlation matrices for numerical variables.
- Patterns in nutrient composition across food categories.
